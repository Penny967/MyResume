1. Set up a new React app: Create a new project using create-react-app. 
2. Create the MovieList component: This is the main component that handles the display and filtering of movie data. I need to define an array of movie objects in this step.
3. Render the movie list: Display the movie data as a list item. Use JSX syntax to dynamically generate these elements.
4. Implement filtering: Create a drop-down menu of all unique movie genres. Use React's state management useState to track the currently selected genre.
5. Handle click events: When the user clicks a movie, a pop-up prompt displays the movie title. This requires adding a click event handler to each movie entry.
6. Use state management: Use useState to manage the movie list and the selected genre to ensure that the interface can be dynamically updated according to state changes.
7. Code organization and style: Use import/export to organize components and modules, and apply CSS or other styling methods to beautify the interface.
